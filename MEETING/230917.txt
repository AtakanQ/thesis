- Research about HD maps.
https://developer.here.com/documentation/here-map-content-schema/dev_guide/topics/topology-geometry-model.html#topology-geometry-model

- Think about the inputs that can be extracted from HD maps.
 * # of lanes on road
 * road geometry
 * road representation

- Study chapter 4, 5, 6 of the guidance thesis. (2021_On_Road_Coordinates_for_Autonomous_Vehicle_Guidance)
Read the thesis and think about a way to convert the representation of roads in the thesis to consecutive arc splines (best case).
