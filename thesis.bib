	abstract = {Self-driving vehicles will soon be a reality, as main automotive companies have announced that they will sell their driving automation modes in the 2020s. This technology raises relevant controversies, especially with recent deadly accidents. Nevertheless, autonomous vehicles are still popular and attractive thanks to the improvement they represent to people's way of life (safer and quicker transit, more accessible, comfortable, convenient, efficient, and environment-friendly). This paper presents a review of motion planning techniques over the last decade with a focus on highway planning. In the context of this article, motion planning denotes path generation and decision making. Highway situations limit the problem to high speed and small curvature roads, with specific driver rules, under a constrained environment framework. Lane change, obstacle avoidance, car following, and merging are the situations addressed in this paper. After a brief introduction to the context of autonomous ground vehicles, the detailed conditions for motion planning are described. The main algorithms in motion planning, their features, and their applications to highway driving are reviewed, along with current and future challenges and open issues.},

Such paths have a discontinuous curvature that makes them dicult to track (curvature is related to the orientation of the front wheels). The purpose of this paper is to present one of the rst path planner for car-like robots that computes paths with continuous-curvature and upper-bounded curvature derivative (curvature derivative is related to the steering velocity). The approach presented herein relies upon a steering method, i.e. an algorithm that computes paths without taking into account the obstacles of the environment, which is then embedded within a general path planning scheme in order to deal with the obstacles and thus solve the full problem. The paths computed are made up of line segments, circular arcs and clothoid arcs.

	abstract = {A new roadmap framework is proposed to improve the guidance and trajectory prediction capabilities of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Independent of road shape determination through external sensors, the system serves as a backup for challenging conditions, such as low sensor visibility and adverse environmental effects (e.g., rain, fog, snow). Based on the fusion of vehicle dynamics principles, differential geometry, and road design standards, the roadmap framework provides a consolidated collection of critical reference points of roadway centerlines and information about the shape of the roadway in the vicinity of a vehicle, including curvature, optimal travel velocity, and road alignment angle. Finally, the proposed roadmap for CAV reference offers versatility as additional data can be appended to the map, including elevation and roadside slope data, variable speed limits, and lane controls.

	title = {Fast and accurate {G1} fitting of clothoid curves},
	abstract = {A new effective solution to the problem of Hermite \$G{\textasciicircum}1\$ interpolation with a clothoid curve is here proposed, that is a clothoid that interpolates two given points in a plane with assigned unit tangent vectors. The interpolation problem is a system of three nonlinear equations with multiple solutions which is difficult to solve also numerically. Here the solution of this system is reduced to the computation of the zeros of one single function in one variable. The location of the zero associated to the relevant solution is studied analytically: the interval containing the zero where the solution is proved to exists and to be unique is provided. A simple guess function allows to find that zero with very few iterations in all possible configurations. 
The computation of the clothoid curves and the solution algorithm call for the evaluation of Fresnel related integrals. Such integrals need asymptotic expansions near critical values to avoid loss of precision. This is necessary when, for example, the solution of the interpolation problem is close to a straight line or an arc of circle. A simple algorithm is presented for efficient computation of the asymptotic expansion.
The reduction of the problem to a single nonlinear function in one variable and the use of asymptotic expansions make the present solution algorithm fast and robust. In particular a comparison with algorithms present in literature shows that the present algorithm requires less iterations. Moreover accuracy is maintained in all possible configurations while other algorithms have a loss of accuracy near the transition zones.

	abstract = {According to the mobile robot researchers and experts the best and smoothest transition curve to be used as a section of the path is the Eulers Spiral also known as Clothoid. During 19th century Arthur Talbot derived the equation of Clothoids to use as an easement curve for the purpose of avoiding the shock and disagreeable lurch of trains, due to instant change of direction. The Euler Spiral is a curve whose degree-of-curve increases directly with the distance along the curve from the start point of the spiral. This will provide a linear change in the steering angle required by the driver to go through the turn. In other word for a car which is travelling on a Clothoid transition curve of the road there will be no need for sudden changes in the steering angle of the wheels. The angle required starts from zero and increases to a maximum value and back to zero linearly. This provides a very comfortable ride for the passengers of the vehicle. The use of these curves for road design have been studied here, and a design chart have been proposed to be used for finding the best suitable transition curve for different applications.},

In this connection, motion planning algorithms play a key role as they are responsible of ensuring driving safety and comfort while producing human-like trajectories in a wide range of driving scenarios. Typical approaches for motion planning focus on trajectory optimization by applying computation-intensive algorithms, rather than finding a balance between optimatily and computing time. However, for on-road automated driving at medium and high speeds, determinism is necessary at high sampling rates. This work presents a trajectory planning algorithm that is able to provide safe, human-like and comfortable trajectories by using cost-effective primitives evaluation based on quintic Bézier curves. The proposed method is able to consider the kinodynamic constrains of the vehicle while reactively handling dynamic real environments in real-time. The proposed motion planning strategy has been implemented in a real experimental platform and validated in different real operating environments, successfully overcoming typical urban traffic scenes where both static and dynamic objects are involved.},

The presented framework employs a two-step motion planning architecture. In the first step, a Support Vector Machine based approach is developed to refine the reference path through maximizing the lateral distance to boundaries of the constructed corridor while ensuring curvature-continuity. In the second step, a set of terminal states are sampled aligned with the refined reference path. Then, to satisfy system constraints, a model predictive path generation method is utilized to generate multiple path candidates, which connect the current vehicle state with the sampling terminal states. Simultaneously the velocity profiles are assigned to guarantee safe and comfort driving motions. Finally, an optimal trajectory is selected based on a specified objective function via a discrete optimization scheme. The simulation results demonstrate the planner's capability to generate dynamically-feasible trajectories in real time and enable the vehicle to drive safely and smoothly along a rough reference path while avoiding static obstacles.},

	abstract = {In this work we put forward a predictive trajectory planning framework to help autonomous vehicles plan future trajectories. We develop a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to model this sequential decision making problem, and a deep reinforcement learning solution methodology to learn high-quality policies. The POMDP model utilizes driving scenarios, condensed into graphs, as inputs. More specifically, an input graph contains information on the history trajectory of the subject vehicle, predicted trajectories of other agents in the scene (e.g., other vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists), as well as predicted risk levels posed by surrounding vehicles to devise safe, comfortable, and energy-efficient trajectories for the subject vehicle to follow. In order to obtain sufficient driving scenarios to use as training data, we propose a simulation framework to generate socially acceptable driving scenarios using a real world autonomous vehicle dataset. The simulation framework utilizes Bayesian Gaussian mixture models to learn trajectory patterns of different agent types, and Gibbs sampling to ensure that the distribution of simulated scenarios matches that of the real-world dataset collected by an autonomous fleet. We evaluate the proposed work in two complex urban driving environments: a non-signalized T-junction and a non-signalized lane merge intersection. Both environments provide vastly more complex driving scenarios compared to a highway driving environment, which has been mostly the focus of previous studies. The framework demonstrates promising performance for planning horizons as long as five seconds. We compare safety, comfort, and energy efficiency of the planned trajectories against human-driven trajectories in both experimental driving environments, and demonstrate that it outperforms human-driven trajectories in a statistically significant fashion in all aspects.},

In this sense, the digital map is the crucial component for relating the location of the vehicle and identifying the different road features. This work presents an automatic procedure for generating driving corridors from OpenStreetMap. The proposed method expands the original map representation, replacing polylines by polynomial-based roads, whose sections are defined using cubic Bézier curves. All curves are automatically adjusted from the original road description, thus generating an efficient and accurate road representation without human intervention. Finally, the driving corridors are generated as a concatenation of the modified road sections along a planned route. The proposed approach has been validated on a peri-urban environment, for which corridors where successfully generated in all cases.},

	abstract = {In this paper a nested PID steering control in vision based autonomous vehicles is designed and experimentally tested to perform path following in the case of roads with an uncertain curvature. The control input is the steering wheel angle: it is designed on the basis of the yaw rate, measured by a gyroscope, and the lateral offset, measured by the vision system as the distance between the road centerline and a virtual point at a fixed distance from the vehicle. No lateral acceleration and no lateral speed measurements are required. A PI active front steering control based on the yaw rate tracking error is used to improve the vehicle steering dynamics. The yaw rate reference is computed by an external control loop which is designed using a PID control with a double integral action based on the lateral offset to reject the disturbances on the curvature which increase linearly with respect to time. The proposed control scheme leads to a nested architecture with two independent control loops that allows us to design standard PID controls in a multivariable context (two outputs, one input). The robustness of the controlled system is theoretically investigated with respect to speed variations and uncertain vehicle physical parameters. Several simulations are carried out on a standard big sedan CarSim vehicle model to explore the robustness with respect to unmodelled effects. The simulations show reduced lateral offset and new stable μ-split braking maneuvres in comparison with the model predictive steering controller implemented by CarSim. Finally the proposed control law is successfully tested by experiments using a Peugeot 307 prototype vehicle on the test track in Satory, 20km west of Paris.},

	abstract = {For driving safely and comfortably, the long-term trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles is essential for autonomous vehicles. For handling the uncertain nature of trajectory prediction, deep-learning-based approaches have been proposed previously. An on-road vehicle must obey road geometry, i.e., it should run within the constraint of the road shape. Herein, we present a novel road-aware trajectory prediction method which leverages the use of high-definition maps with a deep learning network. We developed a data-efficient learning framework for the trajectory prediction network in the curvilinear coordinate system of the road and a lane assignment for the surrounding vehicles. Then, we proposed a novel output-constrained sequence-to-sequence trajectory prediction network to incorporate the structural constraints of the road. Our method uses these structural constraints as prior knowledge for the prediction network. It is not only used as an input to the trajectory prediction network, but is also included in the constrained loss function of the maneuver recognition network. Accordingly, the proposed method can predict a feasible and realistic intention of the driver and trajectory. Our method has been evaluated using a real traffic dataset, and the results thus obtained show that it is data-efficient and can predict reasonable trajectories at merging sections.},

The roadway map generation algorithm is composed of three steps, namely, data acquisition, data processing, and road modeling. In the data acquisition step, raw trajectory and motion data for map generation are acquired through exploration using a probe vehicle equipped with GPS and on-board sensors. The data processing step then processes the acquired trajectory and motion data into roadway geometry data. GPS trajectory data are unsuitable for direct roadway map use by autonomous cars due to signal interruptions and multipath; therefore, motion information from the on-board sensors is applied to refine the GPS trajectory data. A fixed-interval optimal smoothing theory is used for a refinement algorithm that can improve the accuracy, continuity, and reliability of road geometry data. Refined road geometry data are represented into the B-spline road model. A gradual correction algorithm is proposed to accurately represent road geometry with a reduced amount of control parameters. The developed map generation algorithm is verified and evaluated through experimental studies under various road geometry conditions. The results show that the generated roadway map is sufficiently accurate and reliable to utilize for autonomous driving.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the real-time trajectory planning problem for autonomous vehicles driving in realistic urban environments. To solve the complex navigation problem, we adopt a hierarchical motion planning framework. First, a rough reference path is extracted from the digital map using commands from the high-level behavioral planner. The conjugate gradient nonlinear optimization algorithm and the cubic B-spline curve are employed to smoothen and interpolate the reference path sequentially. To follow the refined reference path as well as handle both static and moving objects, the trajectory planning task is decoupled into lateral and longitudinal planning problems within the curvilinear coordinate framework. A rich set of kinematically feasible path candidates are generated to deal with the dynamic traffic both deliberatively and reactively. In the meanwhile, the velocity profile generation is performed to improve driving safety and comfort. After that, the generated trajectories are carefully evaluated by an objective function, which combines behavioral decisions by reasoning about the traffic situations. The optimal collision-free, smooth, and dynamically feasible trajectory is selected and transformed into commands executed by the low-level lateral and longitudinal controllers. Field experiments have been carried out with our test autonomous vehicle on the realistic inner-city roads. The experimental results demonstrated capabilities and effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning framework and algorithms to safely handle a variety of typical driving scenarios, such as static and moving objects avoidance, lane keeping, and vehicle following, while respecting the traffic rules.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a technique based on the probabilistic road map algorithm for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. The objective is to provide an algorithm allowing to compute the trajectory of the vehicle by reducing the distance traveled and minimizing the lateral deviation and relative yaw angle of the vehicle with respect to the reference trajectory, while maximizing its longitudinal speed. The vehicle is considered as a 3 Degree-of-Freedom bicycle model and a Model Predictive Control algorithm is implemented to control the lateral and longitudinal dynamics. Both the control and trajectory generation algorithms take the road lane boundaries as the only input from the surrounding environment exploiting a simulated camera. The performance of the technique is compared with the case in which the reference trajectory is the central line between the lane boundaries. The proposed algorithm is validated in a simulated driving scenario.},

Sufficient accuracy of road geometry with emphasis on road centerline positions and curvature is crucial. In this paper is presented a method for finding road centerline curvature from raw GPS data. The approach consists of a few processing steps. First it is necessary to fit raw data of each road section using B-splines, and generate equidistant vertices of polyline of the fitted curve. Then follows the appliance of stereographic projection of chosen polyline segments onto the unit sphere. Using the least square method, the plane that best fits the points on the unit sphere is found and the circle that is the intersection of the plane and the unit sphere. Stereographic projection of this circle back to the equatorial plane gives the corresponding circular arc and curvature. The method is also applicable in higher dimensions. The 3D case is numerically presented and results show that the proposed procedure is efficient and yields accurate results.},

	abstract = {Many studies in the field of robot navigation have focused on environment representation and localization. The goal of map representation is to summarize spatial information in topological and geometrical abstracts. By providing strong priors, maps improve the performance and reliability of automated robots. Due to the transition to fully automated driving in recent years, there has been a constant effort to design methods and technologies to improve the precision of road participants and the environment’s information. Among these efforts is the high-definition (HD) map concept. Making HD maps requires accuracy, completeness, verifiability, and extensibility. Because of the complexity of HD mapping, it is currently expensive and difficult to implement, particularly in an urban environment. In an urban traffic system, the road model is at least a map with sets of roads, lanes, and lane markers. While more research is being dedicated to mapping and localization, a comprehensive review of the various types of map representation is still required. This paper presents a brief overview of map representation, followed by a detailed literature review of HD maps for automated vehicles. The current state of autonomous vehicle (AV) mapping is encouraging, the field has matured to a point where detailed maps of complex environments are built in real time and have been proved useful. Many existing techniques are robust to noise and can cope with a large range of environments. Nevertheless, there are still open problems for future research. AV mapping will continue to be a highly active research area essential to the goal of achieving full autonomy.},

This is particularily true for OpenStreetMap which provides, among many features, road networks at worldwide coverage. Furthermore, most approaches for creating more detailed networks, such as carriageways or lanes, focus on doing so from sources that are not easy to acquire, such as satellite imagery or LiDAR scans. In this paper we present a methodology to create carriageways based on OpenStreetMap’s centrelines and open access areal representations (i.e. polygons) to determine which roads should be represented as two individual carriageways. We applied our methodology in five areas across four different countries with different built environments. We analysed the outcome in a delivery routing problem to evaluate the validity of our results. Our results suggest that this method can be effectively applied to create carriageways anywhere in the world, as long as there is sufficient coverage by OpenStreetMap and an areal representation dataset of roads.},

Centerline locations originate in a ground-based mobile mapping system (e.g., global navigation satellite system/inertial navigation system vehicle trajectory or kinematic laser scanning profiles of the road/railway corridor). The core of the algorithm resides on the use, manipulation, and suitable reformulations of the bearing diagram of the centerline locations and its first- and second-order derivatives. To ensure highly accurate and consistent results, the algorithm practices a series of specifically designed/dynamically tuned filters that fully adhere to the fractal properties of the centerline location data. Extended test runs were undertaken to validate the correctness of the mathematical model and the feasibility of the algorithms and associated software. In this paper, test results using a simulated and a real (based on a multisensor geodetic survey) subset of a railway track data are discussed.},

This paper presents various results of a mapping strategy which uses smooth arc splines as geometric model. For any given tolerance, the curve approximation method (SMAP) generates a smooth arc spline with the minimally possible number of curve segments. The evaluation shows the performance of this method regarding the accuracy, the data volume and significant curvature characteristics on both rural and highway roads. It can be stated that the arc spline approximation generally outperforms polygonal representations regarding the information content and the number of segments which has a direct influence on the computational complexity of map calculations and the required data volume for the map storage. These properties are beneficial for many driver assistance system applications like autonomous driving. Furthermore, it is shown that the curvature estimation in the curve apexes is widely stable for a broad range of approximation tolerance values which is crucial for curve speed warnings.},

Second, we present a derivative-free global path modification algorithm to extract high-order state information in free space for state sampling. Third, we extend the regular state-space sampling method widely used in on-road autonomous driving systems to a multi-phase deterministic state-space sampling method that is able to approximate complex maneuvers. Fourth, we improve collision checking accuracy and efficiency by using a different car footprint approximation strategy and a two-phase collision checking routine. A range of challenging simulation experiments show that the proposed method returns high-quality trajectories in real time and outperforms existing planners, such as hybrid A* and conjugate-gradient descent path smoother in terms of path quality, efficiency, and computation resources used.},

To incorporate new information as it is sensed, planning is done in a loop, with the next plan being computed as the previous plan is executed. Reachability-based Trajectory Design (RTD) is a recent, provably safe, realtime algorithm for trajectory planning. RTD consists of an offline Forward Reachable Set (FRS) computation of the vehicle tracking parameterized trajectories; and online trajectory optimization using the FRS to map obstacles to constraints in a provably-safe way. In the literature, RTD has only been applied to small mobile robots. The contribution of this work is RTD on a passenger vehicle in CarSim, with a full powertrain model, chassis and tire dynamics. RTD operates the vehicle safely at up to 15 m/s on a two-lane road around randomly-placed obstacles only known to the vehicle when detected within its sensor horizon. RTD is compared with a Nonlinear Model-Predictive Control (NMPC) and a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) approach. The experiment demonstrates RTD's ability to plan safe trajectories in real time, in contrast to the existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

Rule-based, supervised and reinforcement learning control models, test environments, accelerated test methods and assessment indicators of the corresponding literature are reviewed and evaluated. After investigating the different metrics, we formulate an evaluation framework that can be applied in the development and assessment process of new artificial intelligence controlled models. As an outcome of this work, we aim to aid a missing sector in the field of autonomous driving function development by collecting and defining metrics that intend to help qualitatively evaluate and compare algorithms. The key aspect during the definition of the suggested method was to ensure its extensive applicability by selecting only metrics that can be obtained from the already installed sensors of the vehicles. Additionally, we also assess multiple agents to observe how their behavior compares and whether the proposed metrics reflect the expected behavior.},

In this paper, we present a probabilistic approach to autonomous robot navigation using data from OpenStreetMap that associates tracks from Open-StreeetMap with the trails detected by the robot based on its 3D-LiDAR data. It combines semantic terrain information, derived from the 3D-LiDAR data, with a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo technique to match the tracks from OpenStreetMap with the sensor data. This enables our robot to utilize OpenStreetMap for navigation planning and to still stay on the trails during the execution of these plans. We present the results of extensive experiments carried out in real world settings that demonstrate the robustness of our system regarding the alignment of the vehicle pose relative to the OpenStreetMap data.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces an efficient motion planning method for on-road driving of the autonomous vehicles, which is based on the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm. RRT is an incremental sampling-based algorithm and is widely used to solve the planning problem of mobile robots. However, due to the meandering path, the inaccurate terminal state, and the slow exploration, it is often inefficient in many applications such as autonomous vehicles. To address these issues and considering the realistic context of on-road autonomous driving, we propose a fast RRT algorithm that introduces a rule-template set based on the traffic scenes and an aggressive extension strategy of search tree. Both improvements lead to a faster and more accurate RRT toward the goal state compared with the basic RRT algorithm. Meanwhile, a model-based prediction postprocess approach is adopted, by which the generated trajectory can be further smoothed and a feasible control sequence for the vehicle would be obtained. Furthermore, in the environments with dynamic obstacles, an integrated approach of the fast RRT algorithm and the configuration-time space can be used to improve the quality of the planned trajectory and the replanning. A large number of experimental results illustrate that our method is fast and efficient in solving planning queries of on-road autonomous driving and demonstrate its superior performances over previous approaches.},

	abstract = {Trajectory planning is of vital importance to decision-making for autonomous vehicles. Currently, there are three popular classes of cost-based trajectory planning methods: sampling-based, graph-search-based, and optimization-based. However, each of them has its own shortcomings, for example, high computational expense for sampling-based methods, low resolution for graph-search-based methods, and lack of global awareness for optimization-based methods. It leads to one of the challenges for trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles, which is improving planning efficiency while guaranteeing model feasibility. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid planning framework composed of two modules, which preserves the strength of both graph-search-based methods and optimization-based methods, thus enabling faster and smoother spatio-temporal trajectory planning in constrained dynamic environment. The proposed method first constructs spatio-temporal driving space based on directed acyclic graph and efficiently searches a spatio-temporal trajectory using the improved A* algorithm. Then taking the search result as reference, locally convex feasible driving area is designed and model predictive control is applied to further optimize the trajectory with a comprehensive consideration of vehicle kinematics and moving obstacles. Results simulated in four different scenarios all demonstrated feasible trajectories without emergency stop or abrupt steering change, which is kinematic-smooth to follow. Moreover, the average planning time was 31 ms, which only took 59.05\%, 18.87\%, and 0.69\%, respectively, of that consumed by other state-of-the-art trajectory planning methods, namely, maximum interaction defensive policy, sampling-based method with iterative optimizations, and Graph-search-based method with Dynamic Programming.},

The most significant challenge is the uncertainties brought by complex interactions with other road users in diverse driving scenarios. Previous rule-based solutions lack generalization and only suit for limited simple environments. Moreover, another approach generates feasible action sequences based on motion planning, which ignores the interactions between vehicle participants. This paper proposes a hierarchical framework based on reinforcement learning for autonomous driving. Instead of directly mapping the sensor information to the low-level control signal, we first choose a desired state and generate a target trajectory in a Frenet frame according to the desired state. Then a low-level controller is used to track the target trajectory. A reinforcement learning algorithm combining planning and learning is introduced to choose the desired state. This trajectory planning framework is evaluated on a lane switching case in a simulated environment. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Autonomous vehicles are controlled today either based on sequences of decoupled perception-planning-action operations, either based on End2End or deep reinforcement learning (DRL) systems. Current deep learning solutions for autonomous driving are subject to several limitations (e.g., they estimate driving actions through a direct mapping of sensors to actuators, or require complex reward shaping methods). Although the cost function used for training can aggregate multiple weighted objectives, the gradient descent step is computed by the backpropagation algorithm using a single-objective loss. To address these issues, we introduce 
NeuroTrajectory
, which is a multiobjective neuroevolutionary approach to local state trajectory learning for autonomous driving, where the desired state trajectory of the ego-vehicle is estimated over a finite prediction horizon by a
perception-planning
deep neural network. In comparison to DRL methods, which predict optimal actions for the upcoming sampling time, we estimate a sequence of optimal states that can be used for motion control. We propose an approach which uses genetic algorithms for training a population of deep neural networks, where each network individual is evaluated based on a multi-objective fitness vector, with the purpose of establishing a so-called
Pareto front
of optimal deep neural networks. The performance of an individual is given by a fitness vector composed of three elements. Each element describes the vehicle's travel path, lateral velocity and longitudinal speed, respectively. The same network structure can be trained on synthetic, as well as on real-world data sequences. We have benchmarked our system against a baseline Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), as well as against an End2End supervised learning method.},

An MPC-controlled vehicle is required to predict its own trajectories in a finite prediction horizon according to its model. Beyond this, the vehicle should also incorporate the prediction of the trajectory of its nearby vehicles, or target vehicles (TVs) into its decision-making. The conventional trajectory prediction methods, such as the constant-speed-based ones, are too trivial to accurately capture the potential collision risks. In this report, we propose a novel MPC-based motion planning method for an autonomous vehicle with a set of risk-aware constraints. These constraints incorporate the predicted trajectory of a TV learned using a deep-learning-based method. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is used to predict the TV's future trajectory based on its historical data. Then, the predicted TV trajectory is incorporated into the optimization of the MPC of the ego vehicle to generate collision-free motion. Simulation studies are conducted to showcase the prediction accuracy of the RNN model and the collision-free trajectories generated by the MPC.},

Typical trajectories of vehicles involve different modes of maneuvers, including lane keeping, lane change, ramp merging, and intersection crossing. There exist prior arts using the rule-based high-level decision making approaches to decide the mode switching. Instead of using explicit rules, we propose a unified path planning approach using Model Predictive Control (MPC), which automatically decides the mode of maneuvers. To ensure safety, we model surrounding vehicles as polygons and develop a type of constraints in MPC to enforce the collision avoidance between the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles. To achieve comfortable and natural maneuvers, we include a lane-associated potential field in the objective function of the MPC. We have simulated the proposed method in different test scenarios and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in automatically generating reasonable maneuvers while guaranteeing the safety of the autonomous vehicle.},

	abstract = {Artificial potential fields and optimal controllers are two common methods for path planning of autonomous vehicles. An artificial potential field method is capable of assigning different potential functions to different types of obstacles and road structures and plans the path based on these potential functions. It does not, however, include the vehicle dynamics in the path-planning process. On the other hand, an optimal path-planning controller integrated with vehicle dynamics plans an optimal feasible path that guarantees vehicle stability in following the path. In this method, the obstacles and road boundaries are usually included in the optimal control problem as constraints and not with any arbitrary function. A model predictive path-planning controller is introduced in this paper such that its objective includes potential functions along with the vehicle dynamics terms. Therefore, the path-planning system is capable of treating different obstacles and road structures distinctly while planning the optimal path utilizing vehicle dynamics. The path-planning controller is modeled and simulated on a CarSim vehicle model for some complicated test scenarios. The results show that, with this path-planning controller, the vehicle avoids the obstacles and observes road regulations with appropriate vehicle dynamics. Moreover, since the obstacles and road regulations can be defined with different functions, the path-planning system plans paths corresponding to their importance and priorities.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a practical trajectory planning framework towards fully autonomous driving in urban environments. Firstly, based on the behavioral decision commands, a reference path is extracted from the digital map using the LIDAR-based localization information. The reference path is refined and interpolated via a nonlinear optimization algorithm and a parametric algorithm, respectively. Secondly, the trajectory planning task is decomposed into spatial path planning and velocity profile planning. A closed-form algorithm is employed to generate a rich set of kinematically-feasible spatial path candidates within the curvilinear coordinate framework. At the same time, the velocity planning algorithm is performed with considering safety and smoothness constraints. The trajectory candidates are evaluated by a carefully developed objective function. Subsequently, the best collision-free and dynamically-feasible trajectory is selected and executed by the trajectory tracking controller. We implemented the proposed trajectory planning strategy on our test autonomous vehicle in the realistic urban traffic scenarios. Experimental results demonstrated its capability and efficiency to handle a variety of driving situations, such as lane keeping, lane changing, vehicle following, and static and dynamic obstacles avoiding, while respecting traffic regulations.},

For many years, maps have helped human drivers make better decisions, and in the future, maps will continue to play a critical role in enabling safe and successful autonomous driving. There are, however, many technical, societal, economic, and political challenges to mapping that remain unresolved. While fully autonomous driving may be some distance in the future, intermediate steps to realize the technology can be taken. These include developing an efficient and reliable storage and dissemination infrastructure, defining minimum data quality requirements, and establishing an international mapping standard. The article closes with 11 open research challenges for mapping for autonomous driving.},

	abstract = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) aim at increasing the traffic throughput and safety, reducing the total travel time and traffic congestion using novel achievements of communication and control technologies. In particular, the development of self-driving vehicles is an important application of ITS that is expected to show a considerable impact in the near future. When implementing self-driving vehicles, the realization of lane changes is a necessary task. Accordingly, this thesis focuses on the computation of longitudinal and lateral maneuvers during lane changes. The thesis first determines several models for the longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics that are deemed suitable for representing normal driving situations. In addition, a novel method for decoupling the longitudinal and lateral motion is proposed. Based on the vehicle models, an optimal control problem for lane change maneuvers is formulated and two methods for the solution of this optimal control problems are developed. The first method is a direct collocation method. Using a given number of collocation points, the optimal control problem is converted to a nonlinear programming problem that can be solved by standard nonlinear programming solvers. The second method is gradient-based. Using a first-order approximation of the system model, a gradient-based search achieves an approximation of the optimal control solution. It is observed during the thesis study that the optimal control solutions cannot be determined in real-time. In order to address this problem, the thesis further studies the approximation of the optimal control trajectories by curves that can be parametrized analytically and that can be computed in real-time. To this end, bi-elementary paths that are based on clothoid curves and their analytical approximation by bi-elementary arc-splines are found suitable. The thesis proposed computational methods for the fast computation of lane change trajectories using these curves. As an application of the developed results, the thesis considers the recent technology of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) for tight vehicle following. Existing CACC designs assume straight roads and hence only consider the longitudinal vehicle dynamics. The thesis extends the existing results to the case of CACC on curved roads.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a set of paths, called bi-elementary paths. These paths are smooth and feasible for a car-like robot (i.e. their tangent direction is continuous and they respect a minimum turning radius constraint), and they can be followed by a real vehicle without stopping (i.e. they have a continuous curvature profile)-which is not the case of Dubins' curves. These paths are composed of arcs of a clothoid (a clothoid is a curve whose curvature is a linear function of its arc length), and are used to define a simplified, i.e. non-complete, planner. This simplified planner is, in turn, used in two global planning schemes, namely the Ariadne's Clew algorithm and probabilistic path planning. This paper proves an important property of the bi-elementary paths, from which the completeness of the two global planners is deduced.},

	abstract = {Path planning for autonomous vehicles in arbitrary environments requires a guarantee of safety, but this can be impractical to ensure in real-time when the vehicle is described with a high-fidelity model. To address this problem, this paper develops a method to perform trajectory design by considering a low-fidelity model that accounts for model mismatch. The presented method begins by computing a conservative Forward Reachable Set (FRS) of a high-fidelity model's trajectories produced when tracking trajectories of a low-fidelity model over a finite time horizon. At runtime, the vehicle intersects this FRS with obstacles in the environment to eliminate trajectories that can lead to a collision, then selects an optimal plan from the remaining safe set. By bounding the time for this set intersection and subsequent path selection, this paper proves a lower bound for the FRS time horizon and sensing horizon to guarantee safety. This method is demonstrated in simulation using a kinematic Dubin's car as the low-fidelity model and a dynamic unicycle as the high-fidelity model.},

This approach incorporates both steering inputs and changes in speed during the maneuver. As a result, varying path parameters and observing the maximum possible entry speed of resulting paths give insight about when and to what extent a vehicle should brake and turn during emergency lane change maneuvers. Tests on an autonomous vehicle validate this approach for lane changes near the limits of friction.},

	doi = {10.1155/2020/8884797},
	abstract = {In order to deeply analyze and describe the characteristics of car-following behaviour of turning vehicles at intersections, the features and application conditions of classic car-following models were analyzed firstly. And then, through analysing the relationship between the maximum velocity of car-following vehicles and the turning radius of intersection, the differences in key variables between turning and straight car-following behaviour were identified. On the basis of Optimal Velocity (OV) model, a Turning Optimal Velocity (TOV) car-following model with consideration of turning radius and sideway force coefficient at intersections was developed. PreScan simulation was employed to build the scene of turning car-following process at an intersection. Based on linear stability analysis, the stability conditions of the TOV model were derived. And it was found that (1) the turning radius has a significant effect on the car-following behaviour of turning vehicles at intersections; (2) with the increase of the distance between vehicles, the driver’s response sensitivity coefficient increases and then decreases and reaches the maximum value when the distance reaches the minimum safe distance; (3) with the increase of turning radius, the stability of the car-following fleet tends to decrease, and it is more likely to become a stop-and-go traffic flow. In addition, the numerical simulation results indicate that the TOV model can describe the car-following behaviour of turning vehicles more accurately with consideration of turning radius. The findings of this study can be used in the development of microscopic traffic simulation software and for improving traffic safety at intersections.},
