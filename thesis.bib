	abstract = {Self-driving vehicles will soon be a reality, as main automotive companies have announced that they will sell their driving automation modes in the 2020s. This technology raises relevant controversies, especially with recent deadly accidents. Nevertheless, autonomous vehicles are still popular and attractive thanks to the improvement they represent to people's way of life (safer and quicker transit, more accessible, comfortable, convenient, efficient, and environment-friendly). This paper presents a review of motion planning techniques over the last decade with a focus on highway planning. In the context of this article, motion planning denotes path generation and decision making. Highway situations limit the problem to high speed and small curvature roads, with specific driver rules, under a constrained environment framework. Lane change, obstacle avoidance, car following, and merging are the situations addressed in this paper. After a brief introduction to the context of autonomous ground vehicles, the detailed conditions for motion planning are described. The main algorithms in motion planning, their features, and their applications to highway driving are reviewed, along with current and future challenges and open issues.},

	doi = {10.1109/TRO.2004.833789},
	abstract = {{\textbar} Most path planners for car-like robots compute Reeds and Shepp paths" made up of line segments connected with circular arcs. Such paths have a discontinuous curvature that makes them dicult to track (curvature is related to the orientation of the front wheels). The purpose of this paper is to present one of the rst path planner for car-like robots that computes paths with continuous-curvature and upper-bounded curvature derivative (curvature derivative is related to the steering velocity). The approach presented herein relies upon a steering method, i.e. an algorithm that computes paths without taking into account the obstacles of the environment, which is then embedded within a general path planning scheme in order to deal with the obstacles and thus solve the full problem. The paths computed are made up of line segments, circular arcs and clothoid arcs.

	title = {On {Road} {Coordinates} for {Autonomous} {Vehicle} {Guidance}},
	abstract = {A new roadmap framework is proposed to improve the guidance and trajectory prediction capabilities of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Independent of road shape determination through external sensors, the system serves as a backup for challenging conditions, such as low sensor visibility and adverse environmental effects (e.g., rain, fog, snow). Based on the fusion of vehicle dynamics principles, differential geometry, and road design standards, the roadmap framework provides a consolidated collection of critical reference points of roadway centerlines and information about the shape of the roadway in the vicinity of a vehicle, including curvature, optimal travel velocity, and road alignment angle. Finally, the proposed roadmap for CAV reference offers versatility as additional data can be appended to the map, including elevation and roadside slope data, variable speed limits, and lane controls.

	title = {Fast and accurate {G1} fitting of clothoid curves},
	abstract = {A new effective solution to the problem of Hermite \$G{\textasciicircum}1\$ interpolation with a clothoid curve is here proposed, that is a clothoid that interpolates two given points in a plane with assigned unit tangent vectors. The interpolation problem is a system of three nonlinear equations with multiple solutions which is difficult to solve also numerically. Here the solution of this system is reduced to the computation of the zeros of one single function in one variable. The location of the zero associated to the relevant solution is studied analytically: the interval containing the zero where the solution is proved to exists and to be unique is provided. A simple guess function allows to find that zero with very few iterations in all possible configurations. 
The computation of the clothoid curves and the solution algorithm call for the evaluation of Fresnel related integrals. Such integrals need asymptotic expansions near critical values to avoid loss of precision. This is necessary when, for example, the solution of the interpolation problem is close to a straight line or an arc of circle. A simple algorithm is presented for efficient computation of the asymptotic expansion.
The reduction of the problem to a single nonlinear function in one variable and the use of asymptotic expansions make the present solution algorithm fast and robust. In particular a comparison with algorithms present in literature shows that the present algorithm requires less iterations. Moreover accuracy is maintained in all possible configurations while other algorithms have a loss of accuracy near the transition zones.

Clothoids are transcendental functions and so have been approximated by polynomials, by power series and continued fractions, and by rational functions. Here the clothoid is approximated by an arc spline. The chief advantage in doing so is that arc splines are very easy to lay out and to offset. Examples show that the approximation is of extremely high accuracy. It is proved that if the arc spline has n arcs, then the error in the approximation is of order O(1/n2).},

	isbn = {978-3-319-17998-8},
	abstract = {According to the mobile robot researchers and experts the best and smoothest transition curve to be used as a section of the path is the Eulers Spiral also known as Clothoid. During 19th century Arthur Talbot derived the equation of Clothoids to use as an easement curve for the purpose of avoiding the shock and disagreeable lurch of trains, due to instant change of direction. The Euler Spiral is a curve whose degree-of-curve increases directly with the distance along the curve from the start point of the spiral. This will provide a linear change in the steering angle required by the driver to go through the turn. In other word for a car which is travelling on a Clothoid transition curve of the road there will be no need for sudden changes in the steering angle of the wheels. The angle required starts from zero and increases to a maximum value and back to zero linearly. This provides a very comfortable ride for the passengers of the vehicle. The use of these curves for road design have been studied here, and a design chart have been proposed to be used for finding the best suitable transition curve for different applications.},

	abstract = {Autonomous vehicles must be able to react in a timely manner to typical and unpredictable situations in urban scenarios. In this connection, motion planning algorithms play a key role as they are responsible of ensuring driving safety and comfort while producing human-like trajectories in a wide range of driving scenarios. Typical approaches for motion planning focus on trajectory optimization by applying computation-intensive algorithms, rather than finding a balance between optimatily and computing time. However, for on-road automated driving at medium and high speeds, determinism is necessary at high sampling rates. This work presents a trajectory planning algorithm that is able to provide safe, human-like and comfortable trajectories by using cost-effective primitives evaluation based on quintic Bézier curves. The proposed method is able to consider the kinodynamic constrains of the vehicle while reactively handling dynamic real environments in real-time. The proposed motion planning strategy has been implemented in a real experimental platform and validated in different real operating environments, successfully overcoming typical urban traffic scenes where both static and dynamic objects are involved.},
