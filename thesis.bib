	abstract = {Self-driving vehicles will soon be a reality, as main automotive companies have announced that they will sell their driving automation modes in the 2020s. This technology raises relevant controversies, especially with recent deadly accidents. Nevertheless, autonomous vehicles are still popular and attractive thanks to the improvement they represent to people's way of life (safer and quicker transit, more accessible, comfortable, convenient, efficient, and environment-friendly). This paper presents a review of motion planning techniques over the last decade with a focus on highway planning. In the context of this article, motion planning denotes path generation and decision making. Highway situations limit the problem to high speed and small curvature roads, with specific driver rules, under a constrained environment framework. Lane change, obstacle avoidance, car following, and merging are the situations addressed in this paper. After a brief introduction to the context of autonomous ground vehicles, the detailed conditions for motion planning are described. The main algorithms in motion planning, their features, and their applications to highway driving are reviewed, along with current and future challenges and open issues.},

Such paths have a discontinuous curvature that makes them dicult to track (curvature is related to the orientation of the front wheels). The purpose of this paper is to present one of the rst path planner for car-like robots that computes paths with continuous-curvature and upper-bounded curvature derivative (curvature derivative is related to the steering velocity). The approach presented herein relies upon a steering method, i.e. an algorithm that computes paths without taking into account the obstacles of the environment, which is then embedded within a general path planning scheme in order to deal with the obstacles and thus solve the full problem. The paths computed are made up of line segments, circular arcs and clothoid arcs.

	abstract = {A new roadmap framework is proposed to improve the guidance and trajectory prediction capabilities of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Independent of road shape determination through external sensors, the system serves as a backup for challenging conditions, such as low sensor visibility and adverse environmental effects (e.g., rain, fog, snow). Based on the fusion of vehicle dynamics principles, differential geometry, and road design standards, the roadmap framework provides a consolidated collection of critical reference points of roadway centerlines and information about the shape of the roadway in the vicinity of a vehicle, including curvature, optimal travel velocity, and road alignment angle. Finally, the proposed roadmap for CAV reference offers versatility as additional data can be appended to the map, including elevation and roadside slope data, variable speed limits, and lane controls.

	title = {Fast and accurate {G1} fitting of clothoid curves},
	abstract = {A new effective solution to the problem of Hermite \$G{\textasciicircum}1\$ interpolation with a clothoid curve is here proposed, that is a clothoid that interpolates two given points in a plane with assigned unit tangent vectors. The interpolation problem is a system of three nonlinear equations with multiple solutions which is difficult to solve also numerically. Here the solution of this system is reduced to the computation of the zeros of one single function in one variable. The location of the zero associated to the relevant solution is studied analytically: the interval containing the zero where the solution is proved to exists and to be unique is provided. A simple guess function allows to find that zero with very few iterations in all possible configurations. 
The computation of the clothoid curves and the solution algorithm call for the evaluation of Fresnel related integrals. Such integrals need asymptotic expansions near critical values to avoid loss of precision. This is necessary when, for example, the solution of the interpolation problem is close to a straight line or an arc of circle. A simple algorithm is presented for efficient computation of the asymptotic expansion.
The reduction of the problem to a single nonlinear function in one variable and the use of asymptotic expansions make the present solution algorithm fast and robust. In particular a comparison with algorithms present in literature shows that the present algorithm requires less iterations. Moreover accuracy is maintained in all possible configurations while other algorithms have a loss of accuracy near the transition zones.

	abstract = {According to the mobile robot researchers and experts the best and smoothest transition curve to be used as a section of the path is the Eulers Spiral also known as Clothoid. During 19th century Arthur Talbot derived the equation of Clothoids to use as an easement curve for the purpose of avoiding the shock and disagreeable lurch of trains, due to instant change of direction. The Euler Spiral is a curve whose degree-of-curve increases directly with the distance along the curve from the start point of the spiral. This will provide a linear change in the steering angle required by the driver to go through the turn. In other word for a car which is travelling on a Clothoid transition curve of the road there will be no need for sudden changes in the steering angle of the wheels. The angle required starts from zero and increases to a maximum value and back to zero linearly. This provides a very comfortable ride for the passengers of the vehicle. The use of these curves for road design have been studied here, and a design chart have been proposed to be used for finding the best suitable transition curve for different applications.},

	abstract = {Autonomous vehicles must be able to react in a timely manner to typical and unpredictable situations in urban scenarios. In this connection, motion planning algorithms play a key role as they are responsible of ensuring driving safety and comfort while producing human-like trajectories in a wide range of driving scenarios. Typical approaches for motion planning focus on trajectory optimization by applying computation-intensive algorithms, rather than finding a balance between optimatily and computing time. However, for on-road automated driving at medium and high speeds, determinism is necessary at high sampling rates. This work presents a trajectory planning algorithm that is able to provide safe, human-like and comfortable trajectories by using cost-effective primitives evaluation based on quintic Bézier curves. The proposed method is able to consider the kinodynamic constrains of the vehicle while reactively handling dynamic real environments in real-time. The proposed motion planning strategy has been implemented in a real experimental platform and validated in different real operating environments, successfully overcoming typical urban traffic scenes where both static and dynamic objects are involved.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a state space sampling-based local trajectory generation framework for autonomous vehicles driving along a reference path is proposed. The presented framework employs a two-step motion planning architecture. In the first step, a Support Vector Machine based approach is developed to refine the reference path through maximizing the lateral distance to boundaries of the constructed corridor while ensuring curvature-continuity. In the second step, a set of terminal states are sampled aligned with the refined reference path. Then, to satisfy system constraints, a model predictive path generation method is utilized to generate multiple path candidates, which connect the current vehicle state with the sampling terminal states. Simultaneously the velocity profiles are assigned to guarantee safe and comfort driving motions. Finally, an optimal trajectory is selected based on a specified objective function via a discrete optimization scheme. The simulation results demonstrate the planner's capability to generate dynamically-feasible trajectories in real time and enable the vehicle to drive safely and smoothly along a rough reference path while avoiding static obstacles.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the real-time trajectory planning problem for autonomous vehicles driving in realistic urban environments. To solve the complex navigation problem, we adopt a hierarchical motion planning framework. First, a rough reference path is extracted from the digital map using commands from the high-level behavioral planner. The conjugate gradient nonlinear optimization algorithm and the cubic B-spline curve are employed to smoothen and interpolate the reference path sequentially. To follow the refined reference path as well as handle both static and moving objects, the trajectory planning task is decoupled into lateral and longitudinal planning problems within the curvilinear coordinate framework. A rich set of kinematically feasible path candidates are generated to deal with the dynamic traffic both deliberatively and reactively. In the meanwhile, the velocity profile generation is performed to improve driving safety and comfort. After that, the generated trajectories are carefully evaluated by an objective function, which combines behavioral decisions by reasoning about the traffic situations. The optimal collision-free, smooth, and dynamically feasible trajectory is selected and transformed into commands executed by the low-level lateral and longitudinal controllers. Field experiments have been carried out with our test autonomous vehicle on the realistic inner-city roads. The experimental results demonstrated capabilities and effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning framework and algorithms to safely handle a variety of typical driving scenarios, such as static and moving objects avoidance, lane keeping, and vehicle following, while respecting the traffic rules.},

	abstract = {In this work we put forward a predictive trajectory planning framework to help autonomous vehicles plan future trajectories. We develop a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to model this sequential decision making problem, and a deep reinforcement learning solution methodology to learn high-quality policies. The POMDP model utilizes driving scenarios, condensed into graphs, as inputs. More specifically, an input graph contains information on the history trajectory of the subject vehicle, predicted trajectories of other agents in the scene (e.g., other vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists), as well as predicted risk levels posed by surrounding vehicles to devise safe, comfortable, and energy-efficient trajectories for the subject vehicle to follow. In order to obtain sufficient driving scenarios to use as training data, we propose a simulation framework to generate socially acceptable driving scenarios using a real world autonomous vehicle dataset. The simulation framework utilizes Bayesian Gaussian mixture models to learn trajectory patterns of different agent types, and Gibbs sampling to ensure that the distribution of simulated scenarios matches that of the real-world dataset collected by an autonomous fleet. We evaluate the proposed work in two complex urban driving environments: a non-signalized T-junction and a non-signalized lane merge intersection. Both environments provide vastly more complex driving scenarios compared to a highway driving environment, which has been mostly the focus of previous studies. The framework demonstrates promising performance for planning horizons as long as five seconds. We compare safety, comfort, and energy efficiency of the planned trajectories against human-driven trajectories in both experimental driving environments, and demonstrate that it outperforms human-driven trajectories in a statistically significant fashion in all aspects.},

In this sense, the digital map is the crucial component for relating the location of the vehicle and identifying the different road features. This work presents an automatic procedure for generating driving corridors from OpenStreetMap. The proposed method expands the original map representation, replacing polylines by polynomial-based roads, whose sections are defined using cubic Bézier curves. All curves are automatically adjusted from the original road description, thus generating an efficient and accurate road representation without human intervention. Finally, the driving corridors are generated as a concatenation of the modified road sections along a planned route. The proposed approach has been validated on a peri-urban environment, for which corridors where successfully generated in all cases.},

	abstract = {In this paper a nested PID steering control in vision based autonomous vehicles is designed and experimentally tested to perform path following in the case of roads with an uncertain curvature. The control input is the steering wheel angle: it is designed on the basis of the yaw rate, measured by a gyroscope, and the lateral offset, measured by the vision system as the distance between the road centerline and a virtual point at a fixed distance from the vehicle. No lateral acceleration and no lateral speed measurements are required. A PI active front steering control based on the yaw rate tracking error is used to improve the vehicle steering dynamics. The yaw rate reference is computed by an external control loop which is designed using a PID control with a double integral action based on the lateral offset to reject the disturbances on the curvature which increase linearly with respect to time. The proposed control scheme leads to a nested architecture with two independent control loops that allows us to design standard PID controls in a multivariable context (two outputs, one input). The robustness of the controlled system is theoretically investigated with respect to speed variations and uncertain vehicle physical parameters. Several simulations are carried out on a standard big sedan CarSim vehicle model to explore the robustness with respect to unmodelled effects. The simulations show reduced lateral offset and new stable μ-split braking maneuvres in comparison with the model predictive steering controller implemented by CarSim. Finally the proposed control law is successfully tested by experiments using a Peugeot 307 prototype vehicle on the test track in Satory, 20km west of Paris.},
