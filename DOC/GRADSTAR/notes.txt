Mention about the required data for trajectory planning so we need a suitable road representation YES
Important features for trajectory planning: position, heading and curvature. YES
Roads are designed as clothoids. YES
We want to find a method that removes these disadvantages and is able to match the road design.  YES
Find other road representations and consider their advantages and disadvantages.
Disadvantages:
Not accurate, not able to parallel shift, do not have easy analytical representation
Advantages:


problem statement:
- Find a suitable road representation
Input:
Waypoints (position, heading and curvature)
Output:
Suitable analytical representation of the road
Directly use clothoids since they are already used in the design of the road, but they are not suitable since it does not have an analytical representation
Explain what is an arc spline and it is a good approximation for clothoids.
Find a suitable arc spline representation with small number of parameters.

How is arc splines are computed
How is clothoid is approximated
How are road segments combined into one
Maybe write pseuodocode
How are different lanes are obtained from a single lane representation

results
Show some road segments
Zoom in to real road and approximated road.
Plot the rms and max position error along the trajectory.
Give some results about the combined road segments. (how many were combined etc.)
Think about a table (maybe change the order of arc splines and compare them to each other)

	
The road initially had 325 clothoids.
After approximation and combination of segments the road has 86 clothoids and 179 arcs were used.
Additionaly, 191 lines were used.
Initially there were 325 segments. After combination there are 277 segments.
