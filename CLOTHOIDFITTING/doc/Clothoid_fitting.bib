@article{Florence:2012,
	Abstract = {Piecewise clothoids are 2D curves with continuous, piecewise linear curvature. Due to their smoothness properties, they have been extensively used in road design and robot path planning, as well as for the compact representation of hand-drawn curves. In this paper we present the Super-Clothoid model, a new mechanical model that for the first time allows for the computing of the dynamics of an elastic, inextensible piecewise clothoid. We first show that the kinematics of this model can be computed analytically depending on the Fresnel integrals, and precisely evaluated when required. Secondly, the discrete dynamics, naturally emerging from the Lagrange equations of motion, can be robustly and efficiently computed by performing and storing formal computations as far as possible, recoursing to numerical evaluation only when assembling the linear system to be solved at each time step. As a result, simulations turn out to be both interactive and stable, even for large displacements of the rod. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of our model by handling various boundary conditions for the rod as well as complex external constraints such as frictional contact, and show that our model is perfectly adapted to inverse statics. Compared to lower-order models, the super-clothoid appears as a more natural and aesthetic primitive for bridging the gap between 2D geometric design and physics-based deformation.},

@article{Arechavaleta:2008,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate different possible strategies underlying the formation of human locomotor trajectories in goal-directed walking. Seven subjects were asked to walk within a motion capture facility from a fixed starting point and direction, and to cross over distant porches for which both position and direction in the room were changed over trials. Stereotyped trajectories were observed in the different subjects. The underlying idea to attack this question has been to relate this problem to an optimal control scheme: the trajectory is chosen according to some optimization principle. This is our basic starting assumption. The subject being viewed as a controlled system, we tried to identify several criteria that could be optimized. Is it the time to perform the trajectory? The length of the path? The minimum jerk along the path? We found that the variation (time derivative) of the curvature of the locomotor paths is minimized. Moreover, we show that the human locomotor trajectories are well approximated by the geodesics of a differential system minimizing the norm of the control. Such geodesics are made of arcs of clothoids. The clothoid or Cornu spiral is a curve, whose curvature grows with the distance from the origin.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we describe a novel approach to autonomous dirt road following. The algorithm is able to recognize highly curved roads in cluttered color images quite often appearing in offroad scenarios. To cope with large curvatures we apply gaze control and model the road using two different clothoid segments. A Particle Filter incorporating edge and color intensity information is used to simultaneously detect and track the road farther away from the ego vehicle. In addition the particles are used to generate static road segment estimations in a given look ahead distance. These estimations are predicted with respect to ego motion and fused utilizing Kalman filter techniques to generate a smooth local clothoid segment for lateral control of the vehicle.},

The continuity and smoothness requirements for the designed flyable paths are achieved by the continuous curvature characteristics of CSs. The final curves are minimized in length with the least number of parameters representing the polynomial expression of the path curvature, while satisfying the maximum curvature constraints, equal length constraints, and collision avoidance constraints. The paths are integrated from initial points to final points by a trapezoidal integration algorithm. A nonlinear programming solver is used to calculate the optimized parameters. Simulation results for four simultaneous UAV paths are presented with designated initial and final positions and attitudes.},

@inproceedings{Kanayama:1989,
	Abstract = {Two cost functions of paths for smoothness are defined: path curvature and the derivative of path curvature. Through these definitions, two classes of simple paths are obtained, namely the set of circular arcs and the set of cubic spirals. A cubic spiral is a curve whose tangent direction is described by a cubic function of path distance s. These sets of simple paths are used for solving path planning problems of symmetric posture (position and orientation) pairs. For a nonsymmetric posture pair, two simple paths are used as a solution, based on the fact that the locus of split postures is a circle or a straight line. A posture q is said to be a split posture of a pair (p1,p2) of postures, if p1 and q are symmetric and so are q and p2. The resultant solutions are smoother than those obtained using clothoid curves. This algorithm has been successfully implemented on the autonomous mobile robot Yamabico-11},

This paper presents the method for the symbolic derivation, by means of symbolic manipulation software (Maple), of the equations of the OCP applied to a generic multibody system. The constrained problem is transformed into a nonconstrained problem, by means of the Lagrange multipliers and penalty functions. From the first variation of the nonconstrained problem a BVP-DAE is obtained, and the finite difference discretization yields a nonlinear systems. For the numerical solution of the nonlinear system a damped Newton scheme is used. The sparse and structured Jacobians is quickly inverted by exploiting the sparsity pattern in the solution strategy. The proposed method is implemented in an object oriented fashion, and coded in C++ language. Efficiency is ensured in core routines by using Lapack and Blas for linear algebra.},

@techreport{Kostov:1995,
	Abstract = {{In the present paper we prove some geometric properties of clothoids. A clothoid (or Cornu's spiral) is a plane curve whose curvature is a linear function of its length. In suitably chosen coordinates it is given by Frenel's integrals $x(t)=\int \_0^t\cos (B\tau ^2/2)d\tau $, $y(t)=\int \_0^t\sin (B\tau ^2/2)d\tau $. The clothoid appears in the problem to find (a) shortest plane curve(s) joining two given points with given at them tangent angles and curvatures and with a bounded derivative of the curvature. It turns out that a regular (i.e. of the class $C^3$) point of a shortest curve is either a piece of a clothoid or a line segment. Some of the properties exposed in the paper are used in \cite{K4} to show that when the distance between the initial and final points is sufficiently long, then, in general, shortest paths have infinitely many points of discontinuity of the curvature's derivative. Thus we are led to the problem to discribe a procedure of constructing paths (called Â»suboptimalÂ») longer no more than a fixed constant than the shortest one(s) and which can be constructed explicitly. They are constructed from pieces of clothoids and a line segment (see \cite{K1}, \cite{K2}). The other properties of clothoids exposed in the paper are used in \cite{K1}, \cite{K2} to prove the suboptimal ity of the constructed paths.}},

A stable and efficient algorithm fits a sketched piecewise linear curve using a number of clothoid segments with  G 2  continuity based on a specified error tolerance. Further, adjacent clothoid segments can be locally blended to result in a  G 3  curve with curvature that predominantly varies linearly with arc length. We also handle intended sharp corners or  G 1  discontinuities, as independent rotations of clothoid pieces. Our formulation is ideally suited to conceptual design applications where aesthetic fairness of the sketched curve takes precedence over the precise interpolation of geometric constraints. We show the effectiveness of our results within a system for sketch-based road and robot-vehicle path design, where clothoids are already widely used.},

	Abstract = {We consider path planning for a car-like vehicle. Previous solutions to this problem computed paths made up of circular arcs connected by tangential line segments. Such paths have a discontinuous curvature profile. Accordingly a vehicle following such a path has to stop at each curvature discontinuity in order to re-orientate its front wheels. To remove this limitation, we add a continuous-curvature constraint to the problem at hand. In addition, we introduce a constraint on the curvature derivative, so as to reflect the fact that a car-like vehicle can only re-orientate its front wheels with a finite velocity. We propose an efficient solution to the problem at hand that relies upon the definition of a set of paths with continuous curvature and maximum curvature derivative. These paths contain at most eight pieces, each piece being either a line segment, a circular arc of maximum curvature, or a clothoid arc. They are called simple continuous curvature paths. They are used to design a local path planner. The experimental results are presented},
