-Try to fit clothoid between consecutive points. order of approximation is 20 !!GROUND TRUTH!!
-Try to find "linearly connectable" parts in curvature plot. If found, either connect them with clothoid or just straight lines.
*Need to find a metric to fit the line or method least squares?
*If a clothoid is found between "linearly connectable" parts, maybe check the segment length to determine the order of approximation?
(Maybe change the order of approximation according to the change in curvature? )
