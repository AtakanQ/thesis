-FIND A WAY TO FIT FEWER ARCS
	-Consider RMS error and maximum error as metrics.
	-Number of arcs should depend on
		=Curvature difference
		=Segment length
	find intervals for each dependency.
	-Decide whether to use MVRC method or ground truth.
-FIT STRAIGHT LINES
	-Use your own heading values if possible rather than ground truth
-USE MVRC METHOD AND GROUND TRUTH SIMULTANEOUSLY TO GENERATE PATHS
