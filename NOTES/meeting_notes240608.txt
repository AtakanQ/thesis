-split road segment representation and trajectory generation into 2 chapter [done]
-also add arc spline trajectory generation in the trajectory chapter ( compare them in evaluation)
-evaluation and results should belong to corresponding chapter, not a different chapter [done]
-rearrange arc spline trajectory generation. Heading, curvature and position rectification should be done at the same time
find waypoints where curvature changes
* 2 options here, sometimes arc length is not enough to make the maneuver.
Either choose to keep making the maneuver, then measure the error again then make the maneuver again
Or stop making the maneuver and feed the last attitude as input to next arc
I chose second.
-add grid to plots [done]
