-Change the implementation so that it is compatible with Ardam's paper.
-Look at real roads and inspect (using the method) if their curvature changes linearly. (From: OpenStreetMaps, in the future HERE maps)
-Test the method with real roads and try to reduce the number of arc splines generated. Plot curvatures.
